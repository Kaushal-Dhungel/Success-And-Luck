# The Dance of Destiny: A Statistical Story on Success, Luck, Randomness and Meritocracy.

*In this article, I have attempted a statistical analysis to explore relationship between success and luck, and how our life can be governed by complete random events. The article is available [here.](https://medium.com/@kaushaldhungel01/the-dance-of-destiny-a-statistical-story-on-success-luck-and-meritocracy-cb97b20f3349)*

*The analysis presented here was done using Python, along with the libraries Pandas and Matplotlib.*

Thank You. Have a great day. :blush: :heart: :)
