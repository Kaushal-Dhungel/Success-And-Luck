## About Tailwind

From wikipedia :-
In track and field, wind assistance is the benefit that an athlete receives during a race or event as registered by a wind gauge. Wind is one of many forms 
of weather that can affect sport.
Due to a tailwind helping to enhance the speed of the athlete in events like certain sprint races (100 and 200 metres), 100/110 metres hurdles, the triple 
jump and the long jump, there is a limit to how much assisting wind the athlete may perform under if the performance is to establish a record. 
If a tail wind exceeds 2 metres per second (3.9 kn) the result cannot be registered as a record on any level.[1] However, the results within that competition 
still are valid because all athletes in a race would get equal assistance, and in field events it is just the luck of the circumstance at the moment of the 
attempt. The wind assistance maximums are only in regard to the validation of a record.

Obadele Thompson ran the 100 metres in 9.69 seconds in April 1996 in El Paso. The result would have been a new world record, had it not been for the tail wind 
of >5.0 m/s.[4] This was then bettered by Tyson Gay in June 2008, when Gay ran a time of 9.68 seconds with the help of a +4.1 m/s tailwind.[5] 
That mark was surpassed when Usain Bolt set the current world record the following year, 9.58 with a legal +0.9 tailwind.

## Flo Jo's Controversy
This contains the summary :- https://www.brunel.ac.uk/~spstnpl/Publications/IAAFReport(Linthorne).pdf and it summarises as :-  "An examination of the performances recorded 
at the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials in Indianapolis
shows that Florence Griffith-Joyner's 100-m world record of 10.49 seconds was assisted by a wind that was well in excess of the legal limit of +2.0 m/s."
However, the IAAF has not yet corrected the world record list.  Nine years after the fact, an IAAF study determined, based on a detailed analysis of all heats and qualifiers, 
that the wind gauge had malfunctioned, and 
the correct wind speed for her race was actually +5.0, which would render Flo-Joâ€™s record illegal. Yet the IAAF let it stand. 

## Usain Bolt's record and wind

Several researchers have looked into the advantage gained by tailwind. The majority of studies concern the most popular event in track athletics, the 100m dash.
It has been estimated that an assisting wind of 2m/s improves a performance by approximately 0.10s compared to that achieved in still conditions. In [1], it is 
calculated that if Usain Bolt had been assisted by the maximum legal wind of 2m/s rather that the 0.9m/s registered on the day, he would have clocked a world 
record of 9.53s, 0.05s under his actual time. 
We can use this information to quantify the effect of wind on the 100m event. A maximum legal wind of 2m/s will improve performances by roughly 0.1/10 = 1%.
