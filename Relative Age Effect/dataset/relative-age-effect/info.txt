Coaches and scouts can fall victim to The Matthew Effect. That name was coined by the sociologist Robert Merton, based on this bible verse from Matthew

"For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. â€“ Matthew 25:29"
